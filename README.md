Hi there, I'm Elis, but online I go by Spelis. I'm a 13-year-old self-taught Python developer from northern Sweden. My primary interest lies in developing Python tools and programs, and I enjoy the endless possibilities that programming offers.

In addition to coding, I love snowboarding and spend a lot of my free time on the slopes. I also enjoy spending time watching YouTube and Twitch, as well as hanging out with my friends and playing video games.

Overall, I'm a driven and curious individual who is always looking to learn and grow, whether it's in the world of programming or on the slopes.
